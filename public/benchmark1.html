  <h1>Don’t Steal Meow Food<br>A Game For Wolfie2D<br>Copyright 2022 Jun Yi Lin, Tahmidul Alam, and Prathamesh Patwekar</h1>
  <h2>Introduction </h2>
    <p>“No way! These raccoons stole my food again ugh!”, were the words the kitty named Vanilla said when the raccoons stole all the food she had saved up for summer. In our game, “Don’t Steal Meow Food”, you must help Vanilla to get her revenge against the raccoons. Don’t Steal Meow Food is a 2D, single player, top-down game designed by a team of three university students: Prathamesh Patwekar, Tahmidul Alam, Jun Yi Lin, from the academic course, CSE 380, offered by Stony Brook University. The game employs sprite based animations, collision detection between collidable entities, use of a tiled map,  use of artificial intelligence and use of other 2D game design techniques.</p>
  <h2>Technology</h2>
    <p>Don't Steal Meow Food will be developed for the web platform using the Wolfie2D game engine. We will be using Tiled to make the game level. We will also use FL Studio, Audacity, Chiptone, and other musical softwares for music/sound production. We will use other applications for player construction, animation, and effects.<p>
  <h2>Background Story</h2>
    <p>Vanilla the cat had been living peacefully her entire life, but recently a gang of raccoons invaded her living space and stole all her cat food. Vanilla decides to take revenge on the raccoons and get her food back.</p>
  <h2>Objective</h2>
    <section>Vanilla needs to sneak into areas controlled by raccoons and collect as much stolen cat food as possible and defeat the raccoon’s leader to drive the raccoons out of her living space.</section>
  <h2>Gameplay</h2>
    <section>The game will be a top-down game with six different levels. Player’s goal is to explore the map and finish the objective of each level.

    The objectives include stealing information about raccoon’ base, collecting stoten car food, and defeating special enemies. 

    Vanilla have to deal with the raccoons that poraling the map. They will try to battle Vanilla if they spot her. However, Vanilla has the ability to assassinate the enemy if she can get on the enemy’s back. She can also choose to take down the enemies that spot her before they call for help. 

    Vanilla can find a variety of items in the raccoon's base that can help her complete her mission. Including food that heals her, rocks that distract enemies, and guns that can take down enemies in distance.

    The leaders of raccoons are a lot stronger than normal raccoons and can’t be assassinated. The only way to defeat them is face to face combat.</section>
